## Build your own Railcore

The best way to get started is to thumb through the [**Assembly Instructions**](https://railcore.dozuki.com/c/RailCore_II) and [**Bill of Materials**][bom] first. Then, your options are to self-source using the [BOM][bom], or purchase a kit. Kit options:

* https://www.filastruder.com/collections/railcore (US-Based, kits are comprised of exactly the parts on the [BOM][bom])
* https://hightemp3d.com (EU-Based, kits may not be comprised of the parts on the [BOM][bom])

## Repository Contents

* **DXF** - DXF files for the RailCore II 300ZL & ZLT, typically for sheet cutting. Materials that can be used are in a text materials.md file for viewing.
* **STEP**  - STEP files for the RailCore II 300ZL & ZLT. All printed parts, milled and cut parts.
* **STL**  - contains STL all the parts that need to be printed to produce a Railcore. Some, like Z-Brackets and Z-Yokes, are available in aluminum. See [BOM][bom].
* **auxillary**  - List of auxillary, untested or outdated parts for the RailCore II
  * **font** - contains the font used for the Railcore II 300ZL/ZLT engraving on the panels.
  * **jigs** - contains parts that can be used for alignment or assembly.
  * **print_tests** - contains parts that can be used for testing/tuning a Railcore
  * **outdated parts** - contains parts that are no longer used.
* **upgrade_or_crossgrade_parts** - for official parts that aren't necessary for a base RailCore functionality. (doors or STL's for commercial parts authorised by RailCore Labs)
* **wiring** - contains details on all the custom wiring that is used in a Railcore in WireViz format.

The halo and Y-plate are optional, the motor mount and idler mounts are recommended to be made from aluminum, but machined and finished versions are available, see [BOM][bom].
